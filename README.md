While Bootstrap is much easier and convenient, I am still getting used to the template and making it work so I can get the layout I am looking for. 

For this assignment, I used Sass (which I got permission from professor beforehand). I am able to install sass through npm and compile it locally, which is what I prefer as opposed to using a 3rd party app.
